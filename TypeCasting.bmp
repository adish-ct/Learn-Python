TYPE CASTING 

Type casting in python is the process of converting data type from one to another, for example data type of a variable int converted into float.

Types.
	1. Implicit Type Casting
	2. Explicit Type Casting

Implicit Type Casting:
	It performs by the python intrepreter it self. If you are adding two integers python will convert it to float before the addition.
	
	a = 10		int
	b = 10.5	float
	c = a + b	float - intrepreter will automatically convert this

Explicit Type Casting:
	It performs by the user, using built-in methods to convert the data type of a data. str(), int(), list(), tuple(), set() etc.
	
	a = "10"	string
	b = 20		int
	c = int(a)	int
	d = str(b)	string
